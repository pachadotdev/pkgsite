The goal of pkgsite is to build a minimal website for an R package, with a
navigation menu and a content area. It is inspired by the [pkgdown](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/)
package but it is much simpler and it does not have as many features.

Like pkgdown, pkgsite provides a `build_site()` function that builds the site and
saves it in the `docs/` folder of the package. The site can then be published
using GitHub Pages or any other static site hosting service.

This package does not provide bootstrap or any other CSS framework, it uses a simple CSS
template that can be easily customized.
